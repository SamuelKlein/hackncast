Static API
==========

A Pelican plugin to serialize some site information in JSON. Very usefull if you want to use JavaScript/jQuery to generate some content.

Also, this plugin may be usefull if you desire to remove tag cloud, tag list or categories list generation resposability from Python and let JavaScrip/jQuery handle this and by this means, reduce the site generation time.

Inspired by the [Tipue Search Plugin](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/tipue_search).
